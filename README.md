## Conventions
### 1. Git Conventions
The syntax for naming branches is as follows:
```plaintext
<type>/<short-description>
```
#### Components
Type: Specifies the purpose of the branch. Use one of the following:
```plaintext
feature: For new features.
bugfix: For fixing bugs.
hotfix: For urgent fixes in production.
release: For preparing a release.
chore: For maintenance tasks like dependency updates or configurations.
docs: For documentation updates.
test: For writing or updating test cases.
deploy: For deploy scripts
```
Short-Description: A concise summary of the branch's purpose.
```plaintext
Use (_) to separate words.
Keep it under 50 characters.
```
#### Git Workflows
- Make new branch from develop, not main
- When merged, please add a reviewer for check code change
- If merge conflict happened, please contact to leader or the code conflicted of that person
- Not push force in any case
- Please update the changing of git about once per days for not loose from the latest version too much
- Please sure that the code your written is runnable and if the application is crashed, that is your fault and leader and you will be punished first

### 2. Code convention
- Please write right character
- If the imported is not use, please remove it for the light code
- If there have any difficulty, please ask leader for more support
